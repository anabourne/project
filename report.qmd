## Background

![](data-raw/wood-survey-data-master/neon-logo.png){fig-align="center" width="250"}

[NEON Woody plant vegetation structure dataset](https://data.neonscience.org/data-products/DP1.10098.001) [@DP1.10098.001/provisional]

### Abstract

This data product contains the quality-controlled, native sampling resolution data from in-situ measurements of live and standing dead woody individuals and shrub groups, from all terrestrial NEON sites with qualifying woody vegetation. With some modifications, this protocol adopts guidelines established by the @forestry2012 for measuring tree species. The exact measurements collected per individual depend on growth form, and these measurements are focused on enabling biomass and productivity estimation, estimation of shrub volume and biomass, and calibration / validation of multiple NEON airborne remote-sensing data products. In general, comparatively large individuals that are visible to remote-sensing instruments are mapped, tagged and measured, and other smaller individuals are tagged and measured but not mapped. Smaller individuals may be subsampled according to a nested subplot approach in order to standardize the per plot sampling effort. Structure and mapping data are reported per individual per plot; sampling metadata, such as per growth form sampling area, are reported per plot.

### Data preparation

The data preparation steps are contained in the `data-raw/individuals.R` script.

## Summary statistics

Prepared data were also subset to columns of interest `stem_diameter`, `height` and `growth_form` and subset to complete case. Liana growth forms were removed

```{r}
#| label: setup
#| code-fold: true
#| message: false
##Setup
## Load Libraries
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

##load data
individual <- readr::read_csv(
  here::here("data", "individual.csv")
) %>%
  select(stem_diameter, height, growth_form)

## substting data
analysis_df <- individual %>%
  filter(complete.cases(.), growth_form != "liana")

## order levels
gf_levels <- table(analysis_df$growth_form) %>%
  sort() %>% 
  names()

analysis_df <- analysis_df %>%
  mutate(growth_form = factor(growth_form,
                              levels = gf_levels
  ))
```

The final data set contains a total of `{r} nrow(analysis_df)`.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| label: tbl-print
analysis_df
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| label: fig-growth-form-counts
#| fig-cap: "Distribution of individual counts across growth forms."

analysis_df %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = growth_form, colour = growth_form, fill = growth_form)) +
  geom_bar(alpha = 0.5, show.legend = FALSE)
```

@fig-growth-form-counts shows the distribution of individual acounts across growth forms.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| label: fig-diameter-height-growth-forms
#| fig-cap: "Stem diameter and height across growth forms."

analysis_df %>%
  tidyr::pivot_longer(
    cols = c(stem_diameter, height),
    names_to = "var",
    values_to = "value"
  ) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = log(value), y = growth_form, colour = growth_form, 
             fill = growth_form)) +
  geom_violin(alpha = 0.5, trim = T) +
  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.7, show.legend = FALSE) +
  facet_grid(~var)
```

@fig-diameter-height-growth-forms shows the distribution of stem diameter and height across different growth forms.

# Analysis

## Modelling overall `stem_diameter` as function of `height`.

Initially we fit a linear model of form `log(stem_diameter)` as a function of `log(height)`

```{r}
lm_overal <- lm(log(stem_diameter) ~ log(height), 
                data = analysis_df)
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| tbl-cap: "Overall model evaluation"
#| label: tbl-overall-glance

library(gt)
lm_overal %>%
  broom::glance() %>%
  gt() %>%
  fmt_number(decimals = 2)
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| tbl-cap: "Overall model coefficients"
#| label: tbl-overall-tidy
library(gt)
lm_overal %>%
  broom::tidy() %>%
  gt() %>%
  fmt_number(decimals = 4) %>%
  tab_style_body(
    columns = "p.value",
    style = cell_text(weight = "bold"),
    fn = function(x) {x<0.05}
  )

```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-cap: "Relationship between stem diameter and height across all data."
#| label: fig-overall-lm
analysis_df %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = log(height), y = log(stem_diameter))) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.2) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  xlab("Log of height (m)") +
  ylab("Log of stem diameter (cm)") +
  theme_linedraw()

```

See @fig-overall-lm, @tbl-overall-glance and @tbl-overall-tidy for results.

### Growth form level analysis

We also fit a model with an interaction term with growth form included.

```{r}
lm_growth <- lm(
  log(stem_diameter) ~ log(height) * growth_form,
  analysis_df
)
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| tbl-cap: "Growth Form interaction model evaluation"
#| label: tbl-growth-glance
library(gt)
lm_growth |> broom::glance() |> gt() |>
  fmt_number(decimals = 2)
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| tbl-cap: "Growth Form interaction model coefficents"
#| label: tbl-growth-tidy
library(gt)
lm_growth |> broom::tidy() |> gt() |>
  fmt_number(decimals = 4) |>
  tab_style_body(
    columns = "p.value",
    style = cell_text(weight = "bold"),
    fn = function(x) x < 0.05
  )
```

## Growth forme level analysis

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-cap: "Relationship between stem diameter and height across growth forms."
#| label: fig-growth-formlm
analysis_df %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = log(height), y = log(stem_diameter), colour = growth_form)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.1) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  labs(
    x = "Log of height (m)",
    y = "Log of stem diameter (cm)",
    colour = "Growth forms"
  ) +
  theme_linedraw()
```

See @fig-growth-formlm, @tbl-growth-glance and @tbl-growth-tidy for results.

## Summary section

Our results agree with findings in the literature [@Haase; @THORNLEY1999195; @CANNELL1984299].
